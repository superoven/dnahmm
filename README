DNA EM algorithm
Authors: Taylor Ritenour & Ram Murthy

Estimates the time to most recent ancestor between two given
strings of DNA using the Estimation-Maximization Algorithm.

All txt and pdf plots are stored in ps5data.

Please run from the "hmm" directory, when there:
       - run "make"
       - run "java HMM <initial> <sequence>"
       	 note: <initial would be something like: "initial_parameters_mu.txt"
	       without any kind of ../ps5data/ or anything in front.

This was run on:

java version "1.7.0_12-ea"
Java(TM) SE Runtime Environment (build 1.7.0_12-ea-b08)
Java HotSpot(TM) Server VM (build 24.0-b28, mixed mode)

The plots are output using matplotlib in python 2.7.1+

All plots are already output in the ps5data directory in case
python does not cooperate.
